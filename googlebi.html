							<h1>Google Business Intelligence Capstone</h1>
							<p><b>Tools Used:</b> SQL (BigQuery, Dataflow) and Tableau</p>
							<span class="image right"><img src="images/bi2.JPG" alt="" /></span>
							<p><b>Scenario:</b> As part of my Google Business Intelligence Specialization I completed a capstone project; applying the technical and soft skills I learned during coursework to address a mock scenario. My project was to assist the Google Fiber customer call center team on a business intelligence project, to gain insight into customer satisfaction and trends in repeat callers.</p>  
							<p>Specifically, my role was to create a dashboard to help the customer call center team identify trends in customer activity and monitor project outcomes in the long term.</p>  
							<p><b>Action:</b> I consulted with stakeholders to review the business scenario and develop project planning documents, then created an ETL pipeline to support a reporting table. Finally, I developed a dashboard based on project requirements.</p>
							<h2>Technical Walkthrough</h2>
							<p><b>1.</b> After completing Google's “Foundations of Business Intelligence” course, I reviewed project outlines and stakeholder communications to produce three <b>project planning documents</b>. These documents detailed all project requirements, the metrics and charts needed to meet those requirements, and an initial mockup of the dashboard.</p>
							<p><b>2.</b> Having solidified those project planning documents, I then needed to get my hands on the data and finalize a reporting table. I created an <b>ETL pipeline</b> using <b style="color:rgba(140, 74, 228, 0.592);">SQL</b>(Big Query) to vet and merge multiple datasets into one target table. This was achieved through a pretty simple SQL script below: </p>
							<pre><code>
3.	SELECT*
4.	FROM`google_fiber_MJBS.market_1`
5.	UNION ALL
6.	SELECT*
7.	FROM`google_fiber_MJBS.market_2`
8.	UNION ALL
9.	SELECT*
10.	FROM`google_fiber_MJBS.market_3`
							</code></pre>
							<span class="image left"><img src="images/bi1.JPG" alt="" /></span>
							<p><b>3.</b> Having merged my data into one target table, I finally needed to create the <b>dashboard</b> itself. I connected my target table to <b style="color:rgba(69, 126, 233, 0.592);">Tableau</b>, created the charts based on stakeholder requirements, then compiled everything in one dashboard view. </p> 
							<p> One of the project requirements was to promote user <b>accessibility</b> by incorporating features such as text-to-speech. I incorporated these accessibility elements and finalized my dashboard. </p>
							<h2>Reflection</h2>
							<p>As this was a mock scenario, there weren't any real business outcomes associated with this project. That being said, this was a valuable capstone project to complete. I was able to apply the foundational techniques I learned during my course work and complete and entire project from end to end. Through this all I gained experience with new skills, such as data modelling, and gained a holistic view of all that goes in to a successful BI project. </p>
